=Commit log syntax=

Reviews can also be assigned via commit log messages using a simple command syntax. (Project administrators must enable this option via the Administer/Source page.) Commands consist of a line containing only the phrase "new review:", optionally followed by 1 or more option lines and ending with a description. For example:
{{{
new review:
owner: mike.j.parent
labels: Priority-High, MajorFeature, HotStuff
A large set of changes to the core library.
}}}
One review request is allowed per log message. The "new review" line must be preceded by a single blank line, or must be the very first line in the message. The description consists of the first non-option line until the end of the log message. Default values from the "Review request" issue template will be used for any unspecified options. Valid review request options are:

 *owner
 *cc
 *summary
 *status
 *labels
 *branch

Examples:

{{{
